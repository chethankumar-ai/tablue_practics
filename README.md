# 📊 EXCEL AND TABLEAU Portfolio Project | Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Excel and Tableau Portfolio Project**, where I dive into sample HR data to generate valuable business insights and interactive dashboards. This project is part of my data analyst journey to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I used **Microsoft Excel** for data cleaning and analysis, followed by **Tableau** to build visually appealing dashboards. The goal is to answer common HR-related business questions and showcase my data storytelling abilities.
